--

An example for [react-native-drawer](https://github.com/root-two/react-native-drawer) and [react-native-router-flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux). The example has been developed by using react-native-drawer and react-native-router-flux 2.X.

With this scaffolding you can create side menu (drawer) and navigate between your screens (pages) easily.

For the sake of example the screens below have been created;
* Login
* Register
* Home
* Screen 1
* Screen 2

The scenarios of the example;
* The user opens the app
* The user logins or registers
* The user navigates the screens by using drawer menu
* The user logs out

*The example has been shaped like an* ***Android*** *app. Actually, it is an* ***cross-platform*** *app and you could give shape like an* ***IOS*** *app.*
